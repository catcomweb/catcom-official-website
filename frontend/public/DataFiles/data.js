    aboutPatronSaint : "St Martin (1579-1639) was born in Lima, Peru. He was the illegitimate son of a nobleman and possibly an African woman slave. He had a younger sister but soon after her birth, their father abandoned them.St Martin grew up in poverty with his mother who, unable to support him, sent him for two years to a Care School and then to work and train with a barber/surgeon.St Martin devoted his life to the sick, the poor and praying to the Blessed Sacrament. As a Lay Brother, he begged for alms to feed the hungry, the sick and his Dominican community. Often when there was no more space in their infirmary, he would give patients his own small bed.",
    prayer : "O glorious Saint Martin, whose burning charity embraced all, especially the poor and needy, we humbly turn to you for your intercession. May we, like you, be moved by compassion and generosity, and may we always strive to follow your example of humility and service to others. Saint Martin, pray for us, that we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ. Amen",
