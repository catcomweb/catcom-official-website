    the Father almighty,
    maker of heaven and earth,
    of all things visible and invisible.
    
    I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ,
    the Only Begotten Son of God,
    born of the Father before all ages.
    God from God, Light from Light,
    true God from true God,
    begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father;
    through him all things were made.
    For us men and for our salvation
    he came down from heaven,
    and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary,
    and became man.
    For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate,
    he suffered death and was buried,
    and rose again on the third day
    in accordance with the Scriptures.
    He ascended into heaven
    and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
    He will come again in glory
    to judge the living and the dead
    and his kingdom will have no end.
    
    I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,
    who proceeds from the Father and the Son,
    who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified,
    who has spoken through the prophets.
    
    I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church.
    I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins
    and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead
    and the life of the world to come.
    
    Amen.`,

      "Prayer For The Beatificaion Of the Servant God Maurice Michael Otunga",
    content: `
    O God, you granted your servant
    Maurice Michael Cardinal Otunga the
    grace to be an exemplary pastor at the
    service of the church, making him a
    symbol of humility and love for the
    poor and less fortunate in the society,
    while denying and detaching himself
    from the pleasures of the world.
    Grant, we beseech thee, that we may
    also learn to respond faithfully to the
    demands of the Christian vocation,
    converting all moments and
    circumstances of our life into
    opportunities of loving you and our
    neighbours with joy and kindness, and
    of serving the kingdom of God with
    humility.
    We humbly request you to grant your
    servant Cardinal Otunga a share in the
    glory of heaven which is promised to
    those who have served you well.
    Through his intercession bless the
    Church, our country, our families and
    children, and grant us the favours we
    humbly request, especially (make
    your petitions), through Christ Our
    Lord. Amen `,

    Receive my confession, O most loving and gracious Lord Jesus Christ, only hope for the salvation of my soul. Grant to me true contrition of soul, so that day and night I may by penance make satisfaction for my many sins. Savior of the world, O good Jesus, Who gave Yourself to the death of the Cross to save sinners, look upon me, most wretched of all sinners; have pity on me, and give me the light to know my sins, true sorrow for them, and a firm purpose of never committing them again.

    O gracious Virgin Mary, Immaculate Mother of Jesus, I implore you to obtain for me by your powerful intercession these graces from your Divine Son.
    
    St. Joseph, pray for me.`,

    title: "Prayer After Confession",
    content: `
    What thanks do I not owe to Thee, my God! not only for having created me, redeemed me, and called me into the bosom of Thy Church, but still more for having waited for my return whilst I was wandering from Thee in the miserable paths of sin; for having so often pardoned me, as I hope Thou hast done this day, and for having preserved me from so many other sins, into which I should have fallen had I not been preserved by Thy gracious hand. But my enemies will not cease to tempt until death, and if Thou support me not, alas! I shall soon begin again to offend Thee more grievously than ever. Grant me then, through the merits of Jesus Christ the precious grace of final perseverance. The Divine Saviour has assured us that whatever we ask in His Name, Thou wilt grant it to us. I entreat Thee, therefore, through all that Thy dear Son suffered for me, never to let me forsake Thee any more. I feel the greatest confidence that, if I continue to pray for this grace, I shall obtain it, because Thou hast promised to hear our prayers. But I tremble with fear lest, in some unguarded moment, I should forget my dependence on Thee, fail to invoke Thy help, and thus relapse into my former misery. Grant, therefore, that in all my temptations I may have instant recourse to Thee, by invoking the holy Names of Jesus and Mary. Thus, O my Lord, I may confidently hope to die in Thy grace, and to love Thee forever in heaven, where I shall be sure never to be separated from Thee, and to be consumed in the fire of Thy holy love for all eternity.
    Amen.`,

    I firmly resolve, with the help of Thy grace, to sin no more,
    and to avoid the near occasion of sin. Amen.`,
