            Founded with the vision of creating a spiritual home for Catholic
            students at JKUAT, our community has grown from a small prayer group
            to a thriving family of faith. Since our establishment, we have been
            dedicated to fostering spiritual growth, academic excellence, and
            social responsibility.
          </p>

          <p>
            Through decades of service, CATCOM has been a beacon of hope,
            providing guidance, support, and fellowship to thousands of
            students. Our heritage is built on the foundation of Christ&apos;s
            teachings, the wisdom of the Church, and the commitment of
            generations of faithful students and clergy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today, we continue this sacred tradition, embracing both our rich
            history and our vision for the future â€” always guided by our core
            values of faith, service, and community.
