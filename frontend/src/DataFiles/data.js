Due to the increase in number of CATCOM members, it was suggested that more SCC's be formed to accommodate more catcomers. The then chairman, Erick Otieno appointed a committee to come up with the structure. The report suggested that there be added three more SCC's. two to cater for those residing in University hostels and an additional one to cater for those renting outside the University. Three SCC's were formed namely: St Veronica SCC, St Stephen SCC and St Theresa of the Child Jesus SCC.At around November the same year, the SCC was commissioned by the then Father in Charge, Rev Fr Francis Kiarie, St Augustine Parish. Worth noting, Irene was the first chair lady, and during her time the families were formed. Then the scc could meet once in a week on Thursdays at the halls of residence from 7:00 PM.
