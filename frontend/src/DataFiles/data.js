It is a choir composed of mainly students and a few parishioners.One of the major principles that we value as KMRM is discipline and faith. The belief that there exists God and he's the one giving us life, health and sweet voices to sing and evangelise well.",

  mission: "Evangelism through singing",
  aboutPatronSaint:
    "Romanos the Melodist (born  late 5th-century after 555) was a Byzantine hymnographer and composer,who is a central early figure in the history of Byzantine music.

He was the foremost Kontakion composer of his time. Feast day is celebrated on 1st october.",
  prayer:
    "O Saint Romanos, the Melodist, you who were once a humble singer, but through divine grace became a master of hymnody, we humbly ask for your intercession.May your gift of song inspire us to praise God with heartfelt melodies and words, and may your example encourage us to embrace our own unique talents for the glory of God",
